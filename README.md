# About Cayenne
Cayenne is a self-hosted web app that lets you keep your websites simple, while maintaining control of your data.

## ⚠️ Warning: Work in progress! ⚠️
This app is not yet feature complete. Use in production at your own risk.

## How it works
Create an endpoint for your HTML form, and point its `action` attribute to the endpoint's URL to start receiving form
entries. Accounts are invite-only, giving you ultimate control over who has access to your instance.
